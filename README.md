**Zoom-bot**

A Program which attends your zoom meetings for you.

Written in Python.
Selenium, Schedule, Datetime and keyboard are the only modules used in this program.
This is Version 1.0 of the program.

This Program is solely created for educational purposes.

Looking forward to migrate zoom-bot to cloud a instance to minimize human interaction and achieve full automation.
Also looking forward to write it in C/C++ to minimze memory consumption and reduce code weight.
The Code requires tons of refactoring in order to minimize code duplication and to increase compiling speed.
Found any bugs?? or would like to contribute??. Please feel free to ping me or create a pull request. 

until then, CIAO!!
