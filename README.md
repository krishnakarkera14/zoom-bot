**Zoom-bot**

A Program which attends your zoom meetings for you.

Written in Python.
Selenium, Schedule, Datetime and keyboard are the only modules used in this program.
This is Version 1.0 of the program.

This Program is solely created for educational purposes.

The Code requires tons of refactoring in order to minimize code duplication and to increase compiling speed.
